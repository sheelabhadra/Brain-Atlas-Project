    "\n",
    "- **Category:** Localization and 2D registration of mouse brain images.\n",
    "- **Context:** HOG features can be used for similarity calculation and can account for minor deformations. Angle of cutting can be determined for getting a more accurate atlas.\n",
    "- **Correctness:** Assumptions:\n",
    "    - A candidate cutting angle will be provided at the start to reduce the search space.\n",
    "    - HOG features can handle minor deformations and can be used as a similarity metric.\n",
    "- **Contributions:**\n",
    "    - Finding the cutting angle and then applying the angle rotation to the atlas (perspective transformation).\n",
    "    - Using Markov Random Field (MRF) instead of HOG for similarity measurement in the registration step. MRF is differrentiable.\n",
    "    - Using bilinear model instead of B-spline for non-rigid deformation.\n",
    "    - Using Multi-level grid point placement for handling large and small deformations.\n",
    "    - Contour alignment for low contrast images. (Need to read the method in detail)\n",
    "    - Segmentation to better fit hollow regions in the brain images. (Need to understand this) \n",
    "- **Clarity:** Well written paper validated with experiments on histological slice images. Refers to a few other papers for implementation details."
