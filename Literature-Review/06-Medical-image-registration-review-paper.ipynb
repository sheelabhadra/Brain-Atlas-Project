    "**Global vs local registration:** A methodology is classified as global, if all voxels presented in the region of the interest (ROI) are used. On the other hand, it is classified as local, if only a part of the voxels in the ROI is used. Usually, the intensity-based methods are global and the feature-based methods are local."

Their implementation is very simple as they can be defined by a deformation matrix and a translation vector. However, these transformations are rarely used since they do not usually represent the real deformations involved in the medical images."

    "In the last few years, the use of the intensity-based registration methods has grown considerably compared to the feature-based methods. The turning point came with the introduction of the MI as the similarity measure. Before this introduction, multimodal registration was done mainly on segmented images, since no intensity similarity measure had been proposed that could be generally and efficiently applied to multimodal registration."
