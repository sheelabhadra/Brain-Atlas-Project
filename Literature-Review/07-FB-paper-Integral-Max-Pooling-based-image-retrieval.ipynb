    "    - CNN based representation with max-pooling extending the concept of integral images\n",
    "    - It encodes the maximum `local` response of each of the convolutional filters and is therefore translation\n",

    "- **Contributions:**\n",
    "    - Compact image representation called R-MAC (Regional Maximum Activation of Convolutions) obtained from the convolutional layers\n",
    "    - R-MAC consists of finding short feature vectors of smaller regions in the images and combining them to form a single image vector  \n",

    "    - Using cosine similarity to find relevant images\n",
